# 🌾 Agriculture Data Analysis & Crop Insurance Insights

This project involves an in-depth analysis of crop production and insurance data to derive actionable insights for farmers, government agencies, and insurance providers. It includes tasks such as data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualization, and policy recommendations using various Python libraries.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Crop.zip`: Contains datasets on crop production across states and districts.
- `CropInsurance.zip`: Contains data related to crop insurance schemes such as PMFBY and WBCIS.
- `PMFBYStatistics.csv`: Supplementary dataset with statistics related to crop insurance participation.

## 📌 Objectives

### Crop Production Analysis
- Identify the state with the highest production during Rabi seasons.
- Find the district with the highest yield in Kharif seasons.
- Detect drought years from historical data.
- Determine states producing the most rice and sugarcane.

### Extended Problem Statements
1. Develop five unique problem statements for deeper analytical insights.
2. Recommend suitable crops for insurance based on risk and yield.
3. Time travel scenario: Suggest ideal crops for specific historical years.

### Data Visualizations
- Categorical data analysis.
- Pairplots with KDEs.
- Correlation heatmaps.
- Boxplots and swarmplots.
- Outlier detection and statistical summaries.

## 📊 Crop Insurance Analysis
- Identify:
  - States with the highest insurance share.
  - Crops receiving the most government subsidies.
  - Insurance companies covering the most farmers.
  - Records with state or central government subsidies.
  - Total premium insured for Kharif season (2021).

### PMFBY Statistics
- Correlation study on crop insurance metrics.
- Most and least covered states by number of farmers.
- Districts with largest area insured.

## 🧑‍🌾 Agricultural Policy & Recommendations
Assuming the role of an agriculture officer:
- Generate insights for better farming and insurance policies.
- Recommend data-driven policy improvements.
- Use **GeoPandas** for geographical mapping:
  - Farmers per district/state
  - Insurance penetration
  - Yield heatmaps

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GeoPandas
- CSV/ZIP data handling

## ✅ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/agriculture-project.git
   ```
2. Unzip `Crop.zip` and `CropInsurance.zip` into respective folders.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the notebooks or scripts to begin analysis.

## 📈 Expected Outcomes
- Better understanding of crop trends and yield behavior.
- Improved policy planning for crop insurance.
- Visual representation of agricultural patterns across India.
